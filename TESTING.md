# Chrome Extension Loading Fix - Testing Guide

## Problem Fixed
The LyX Hotkeys Plugin was failing to load in Chrome with these errors:
- "Service worker registration failed. Status code: 15"
- "Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'logger' has already been declared"
- "Failed to execute 'importScripts' on 'WorkerGlobalScope': Identifier 'logger' has already been declared"

## What Was Fixed

### 1. JavaScript Identifier Conflicts
- **Problem**: Multiple files (`core/message-handler.js`, `core/state-manager.js`, `content.js`) declared `let logger;` in the same content script context
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced global `logger` variables with namespace-based `getLogger()` functions
  - Renamed `logger` to `contentLogger` in `content.js` to avoid conflicts

### 2. Service Worker Context Issues
- **Problem**: Background script was importing modules that weren't compatible with service worker context
- **Solution**:
  - Added service worker (`self`) namespace exports to all core modules
  - Created context-aware module getters in `background.js`
  - Added fallback handling for missing modules

### 3. Module Loading Order
- **Problem**: Scripts were not properly exporting to the correct global namespaces
- **Solution**:
  - Ensured all modules export to both `window` (content scripts) and `self` (service worker) contexts
  - Maintained proper loading order in manifest.json

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Validation
Run the validation script to verify all fixes are in place:
```bash
node validate-fixes.js
```

### Chrome Extension Testing

1. **Load the Extension:**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `lyx-hotkey-extension` folder

2. **Check for Loading Errors:**
   - Look for red error messages on the extensions page
   - The extension should load without any JavaScript errors
   - No more "logger already declared" errors should appear

3. **Test Functionality:**
   - Open the `test-extension.html` file in Chrome
   - Try typing in the input fields
   - Test hotkey combinations like:
     - `Ctrl+M` - Math mode
     - `Alt+G` - Greek alpha (α)
     - `Alt+P` - Pi (π)
     - `Ctrl+B` - Bold

4. **Verify in Developer Tools:**
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Check the Console tab for any red errors
   - The extension should load silently without errors

## Expected Results

✅ **Extension loads successfully**
✅ **No JavaScript identifier conflicts**
✅ **Service worker registers properly**
✅ **Content scripts inject without errors**
✅ **Hotkey functionality works as expected**

## Files Modified

- `core/message-handler.js` - Fixed logger conflicts, added service worker exports
- `core/state-manager.js` - Fixed logger conflicts, added service worker exports  
- `content.js` - Renamed logger variable to avoid conflicts
- `background.js` - Added service worker compatibility layer
- `utils/logger.js` - Added service worker exports
- `lyx-parser.js` - Added service worker exports

## Validation Results

All validation checks pass:
- ✅ No logger identifier conflicts
- ✅ Service worker exports present in all modules
- ✅ Background.js service worker compatibility
- ✅ Manifest.json structure correct
- ✅ All JavaScript syntax valid

The Chrome extension should now load properly without any of the original errors.
